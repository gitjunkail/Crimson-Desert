# Crimson-Desert

This version is abandoned as the game had a major update which introduced a brand new market system, as a result, the struture change also affected many other such as ItemData_table.

the reason for this is mostly because the developers want to make the game to run more smoothly by reducing the amount of data needed to be constantly update at realtime.

I am planning to rewrite the whole thing by intro a custom menu and hoook instead of using Imgui and MinHook.
